# CGPT Project: Analyzing a Simple Dataset in Python
# 9 November 2024

# Install Required Libraries (Pandas & Matplotlib):
# Pandas for data manipulation
# Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
!pip install pandas matplotlib

# Import the necessary libraries
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Import matplotlib.pyplot

# Install Jupyter Notebook (recommended for easy data exploration):
!pip install notebook

# Choose a Dataset
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the 'tips' dataset
data = sns.load_dataset("tips")
data.head()

# Explore the Dataset
# Start by getting a quick summary to understand the dataset's structure.
# Get basic information about the dataset
print(data.info())

# Summary statistics
print(data.describe())

# Check for any missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Analyze the Data
# Explore relationships in the data by calculating basic statistics and visualizing them.
avg_tip = data['tip'].mean()
print(f"Average Tip: ${avg_tip:.2f}")

# Scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=data, x="total_bill", y="tip")
plt.title("Total Bill vs Tip Amount")
plt.show()

# Tip Percentage Analysis:
# Calculate tip percentage
data['tip_percentage'] = (data['tip'] / data['total_bill']) * 100
# Display average tip percentage
avg_tip_pct = data['tip_percentage'].mean()
print(f"Average Tip Percentage: {avg_tip_pct:.2f}%")

Step 5: Summary and Insights

Summarize findings with a few insights:

    Average Tip: Use this for benchmarking against other data.
    Relationship Between Total Bill and Tip: Understanding how larger bills influence tipping behavior.
    Tip Distribution by Day: See which days have higher tips, possibly indicating busier periods.
    Tip Percentage: Useful for insights on tipping habits.

Step 6: Next Steps

Once you get comfortable with the basics, explore:

    Correlation Analysis to see relationships between variables.
    Group Analysis (e.g., group by gender, time of day) for deeper insights.

This project gives you a good balance of data exploration, analysis, and visualization. Let me know if youâ€™d like to dive deeper into any specific step!
